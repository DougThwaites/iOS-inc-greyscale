=================

Replace greyscale pixel data with RGBA in iOS .artwork files

To use:
========
<code>
iOS-inc-greyscale.py "Path/To/artwork.file" "Path/To/New/Artwork/Images"

iOS-inc-greyscale
--------
This tool was made to allow for greyscale images to be imported into the iOS
artwork file.

It has only been well tested with the Shared@2x.artwork file but should work with
different artwork files that are layed out the same.

Please use this tool at your own risk, although we tested it with multiple iOS devices
including iphone's 4 and 5 and Ipads it could still be improved beyond its current state and
is not assumed to be anywhere near perfect.

To run this tool:

  iOS-inc-greyscale.py "Path/To/artwork.file" "Path/To/New/Artwork/Images" 



About the author:
--------
I made this script to help a theme designer @Jato_BZ and it is functional but
by no means a reflection of clean and abstracted code, it was made and may be
maintained in my spare time or by the community.

If you have any questions feel free to email me at digi.doc.doug@gmail.com, depending on
my free time I will get back to you as soon as i can.
